# Privacy Policy for Streaks (For YNAB)

**Last Updated:** July 22, 2025

## Beta Disclaimer

**⚠️ Important Notice:** Streaks (For YNAB) is currently in **TestFlight Beta**. As a beta
application, features, functionality, and privacy practices may change between versions. While we
strive to keep this privacy policy accurate and up-to-date, some information may be slightly
outdated or subject to change as the app evolves.

**What this means for you:**

- Features described in this policy may be added, removed, or modified
- Privacy practices may be updated as we improve the app
- We will update this policy when significant changes occur
- The core privacy principles (local data processing, no cloud storage, etc.) remain unchanged

**Future Considerations:**

- Cloud syncing via CloudKit may be added in future versions (especially for Mac compatibility)
- Any cloud features will be opt-in and disabled by default
- Users will always retain the ability to clear their data completely
- Significant privacy changes will be communicated clearly before implementation

## Introduction

Streaks (For YNAB) ("we," "our," or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy
Policy explains how we collect, use, and safeguard your information when you use our iOS
application.

## Information The App Collects

### YNAB Account Data

- **YNAB Access Tokens**: The app securely stores OAuth 2.0 access tokens in your device's iOS
  Keychain
- **Budget Information**: The app accesses your YNAB budgets, categories, and transactions to
  provide habit tracking functionality
- **Transaction Data**: The app analyzes your spending transactions to help you build and track
  spending habits

### App Usage Data

- **Habit Definitions**: Your custom spending habits and goals
- **App Settings**: Your preferences and configuration choices

## Data Processing

### Transaction Analysis

The app processes your YNAB transaction data locally on your device to:

- **Habit Detection**: Analyze spending patterns to identify when you've broken or maintained your
  defined habits
- **Streak Calculation**: Calculate consecutive days/periods where you've maintained your spending
  goals
- **Category Matching**: Match transactions to your defined habit categories for tracking purposes
- **Trend Analysis**: Identify spending patterns over time to help you understand your financial
  habits

### Local Processing Methods

- **Real-time Analysis**: Transaction data is processed immediately when retrieved from YNAB
- **Historical Review**: Past transactions are analyzed to establish baseline spending patterns
- **Pattern Recognition**: Simple algorithms identify when spending exceeds or falls within your
  defined limits
- **No Machine Learning**: The app uses basic statistical analysis, not AI or machine learning
  algorithms

## Data Security

### Security Measures

- **OAuth 2.0**: Secure authentication with YNAB
- **HTTPS Only**: All API communications use TLS 1.2+
- **Keychain Storage**: Access tokens stored securely in iOS Keychain
- **Local Processing**: No data transmitted to external servers beyond authorizing with YNAB to
  retrieve your data
- **Read Only Access**: Access tokens do not have the ability to create or edit data in your YNAB
  account

### Technical Implementation

- **Data Encryption**: All sensitive data is encrypted using iOS Keychain encryption
- **Network Security**: App Transport Security (ATS) enforces HTTPS and TLS 1.2+ requirements
- **Input Validation**: All API responses and user inputs are validated to prevent security
  vulnerabilities
- **No Client Secrets**: OAuth implementation uses Implicit Grant Flow without storing client
  secrets

### Token Management

- **Automatic Expiration**: Tokens expire after 2 hours (YNAB limitation)
- **Secure and Manual Refresh**: Automatic token renewal when needed
- **No Client Secrets**: We use [Implicit Grant Flow](https://api.ynab.com/#oauth-applications) for
  enhanced security

## Data Sharing

### Third-Party Services

- **YNAB API**: We only share data with YNAB's official API for the purpose of authentication
- **CloudKit (Future)**: If enabled by the user, data may be synced via Apple's CloudKit service for
  cross-device compatibility
- **No Analytics**: We do not use analytics services or tracking tools
- **No Advertising**: We do not share data with advertisers

### Third-Party Dependencies

The app uses the following third-party components:

- **Apple Frameworks**: Standard iOS frameworks (SwiftUI, Foundation, Security, etc.)
- **SwiftData**: Apple's local database framework for storing app data
- **SafariServices**: For OAuth authentication flow
- **No External Libraries**: The app does not include third-party analytics, crash reporting, or
  tracking libraries

### Legal Requirements

If you share information with us via support channels, we may disclose this information if required
by law or to protect our rights and safety.

These support channels may include:

- **Support communications**: Emails, GitHub issues, or other support requests you send to us
- **Public feedback**: Reviews, comments, or feedback you post publicly about the app
- **Bug reports**: Technical information you share when reporting issues

**Example**: If you contact us for support and include your email address or device information, we
may be required to disclose that communication if legally compelled to do so. However, we cannot and
will not disclose any of your YNAB data, personal habits, or locally stored app information, as we
have no access to that data.

## Error Handling & Logging

### Error Processing

- **API Failures**: When YNAB API calls fail, the app logs basic error information (error codes,
  timestamps) for debugging purposes
- **Network Issues**: Connection problems are logged locally to help diagnose connectivity issues
- **Authentication Errors**: Token expiration and authentication failures are logged to trigger
  re-authentication flows

### Debug Information

- **Debug Builds Only**: Detailed logging and error information is only available in Debug builds
- **No Personal Data**: Error logs do not contain personal information, YNAB data, or habit
  information
- **Local Storage**: All error logs are stored locally and not transmitted to external servers
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Debug logs are automatically cleared when the app is closed

### Crash Reporting

- **No Third-Party Crash Reporting**: The app does not use external crash reporting services
- **iOS System Logs**: Standard iOS system crash logs may be generated and shared with Apple
  (controlled by iOS settings)
- **No Custom Crash Data**: We do not collect or transmit custom crash information

### Data Access Limitations

**We cannot access any data stored locally on your device.** All data processing occurs locally on
your device, and we have no ability to remotely access your personal information, habits, or YNAB
data. The only data we can access is what you voluntarily share with us through support channels.

## Your Rights

### Access and Control

- **View Your Data**: Access your habit data within the app
- **Delete Data**: Remove habits and clear app data through iOS Settings
- **Revoke Access**: Disconnect from YNAB through the app's settings

### Data Portability

- **Backup**: Use iOS backup features to preserve your app data

## Data Retention

### Data Storage

- **Current Implementation**: All app data is stored locally on your device
- **Future Implementation**: Cloud syncing via CloudKit may be added as an opt-in feature (disabled
  by default)
- **YNAB Data**: Controlled by your YNAB account settings
- **Token Expiration**: Access tokens automatically expire after 2 hours

### Retention Periods

- **Habit Data**: Retained indefinitely until manually deleted or app is uninstalled
- **Transaction Cache**: Cached YNAB data is retained for 24 hours to reduce API calls
- **App Settings**: Retained until app is uninstalled or settings are reset
- **Access Tokens**: Automatically removed from Keychain after 2-hour expiration
- **Debug Information**: Only retained in Debug builds and cleared when app is closed

### Deletion

- **App Uninstall**: Removing the app deletes all local data
- **YNAB Disconnection**: Revoking access removes the app's ability to access your YNAB data
- **Manual Cleanup**: Users can clear all app data through the app's Settings → Data Management →
  Clear All Data
